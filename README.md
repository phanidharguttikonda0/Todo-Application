deleted todos cannot be there as todos were deleted , there will date in which date the todo was created and also at which date the todo was completed , we can also view the todos that are completed , we can also delete the completed todos as well, this is all part of the the todos , additionally we have authenticationvia login , sign up and forgot password. these are all we gonna have for the basic todos application that we are going to create using the mongo db
